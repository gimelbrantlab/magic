Except for the code in the libjkweb/ subdirectory, comprising the libjkweb library,
the software within the bwtoo distribution is using the GNU General Public License.
See http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html for a detailed explanation, but 
basically this restricts the use of this software for other free software and not
for proprietary software, including free proprietary software.

The libjkweb code is copyrighted by the Regents of the University of California
and Jim Kent and is used here with his permission.  The use of that code inside of
proprietary software may be possible with a license, but otherwise it's mainly
intended for academic use.  Apart from a slight reorganization in the structure
of compilation (the makefile and header directory), no modification of the 
libjkweb code is made for the function of the bwtool software.
